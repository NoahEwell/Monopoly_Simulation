# Monopoly_Simulation

Launches the application for several monopoly simulations in which visits to each property are tracked over 1_000, 10_000, 100_000, and 1_000_000 turns (n) respectively. This application relies on underlying data structures from algs4 to function, namely a RedBlackBST symbol table and a Stack. Simulations are based on two possible strategies: A) players are immediately released from jail or B) players must try for doubles or be released after 3 attempts. Percentages are calculated for each of these visits. Results are printed to a "results.txt" file in the resources folder.
This project was created as the final coding project for CSIS2430 Discrete Structures at Salt Lake Community College.
